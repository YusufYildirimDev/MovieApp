# MovieApp

MovieApp application is a mobile application built with Rest apiler derived from "https://api.themoviedb.org/3" base api. It was developed with VIPER design patterns and attention was paid to modularity. Care was taken to write in accordance with the principles of clean code. I am happy to share the application with you as open source.
